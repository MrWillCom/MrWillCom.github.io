## Installation

If you don't have a [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) blog, just [create one](https://hexo.io/docs/).

To install it, just clone this as a Git submodule in your `themes/` directory and edit your `_config.yml`. After that, you should remember to edit `themes/cupertino/_config.yml`.

`_config.yml`:
```yaml
...
theme: cupertino
...
```
