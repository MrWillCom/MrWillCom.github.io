I started to be curious about code in about 2018. And a teacher of mine gave me _C++ Primer Plus_ as a gift. Since then, I started looking for the technologies I like.

I the summer of 2018, I even created my first blog without any site generators, all by my hands. Without CSS and JavaScript, I put all the stylesheets in attribute `style` and all the buttons are powered by links.

I joined GitHub in 2019 with my websites.

By trying, learning and practicing JavaScript, CSS and more, a year was past.

In 2020, I became more confident in my skills. I published two packages, [videoplayer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/videoplayer.js) and [tooltiplery.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tooltiplery.js) to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) in spring, 2020. They are no longer supported.

In summer, 2020, I created my new blog with Hexo, which you are currently visiting. Also, I made a brand new theme for my new blog - [Theme Cupertino](https://github.com/MrWillCom/hexo-theme-cupertino). Plus, I started contributing some open source projects.

I published a browser extension called [GitHub Dark Mode](https://github.com/MrWillCom/github-dark-mode) to implementdark mode for GitHub.com.

In autumn 2020, GitHub officially implemented their dark mode, so GitHub Dark Mode was archived. For some enhanced visual features on GitHub.com, I published [GitHub Enhancing](https://github.com/MrWillCom/github-enhancing). It adds acrylic and some animations to GitHub.com, which makes it more interactive.

In summer 2021, [RSA CLI](https://rsa.js.org/) turned stable, and [RSA GUI](https://github.com/MrWillCom/rsa-gui) was in beta test.
