## Me

In 2018, A teacher of mine gave me _C++ Primer Plus_ at that time, I started coding then. I looked for how to start coding online and learned HTML and C++ from it.

I've started working on open source projects since the summer of 2018. But I joined GitHub in 2019.

At present, I'm working on Node.js.

I'm just loving coding, but nothing else.

I always work on my open source porjects at weekends. So if you submitted an issue or a pull request, I will respond only at weekends, but sometimes on weekdays.
