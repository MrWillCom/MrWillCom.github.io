## About Me

I started to be curious about code in about 2018. And a teacher of mine gave me _C++ Primer Plus_ as a gift. Since then, I started looking for the technologies I like.

In the summer of 2018, I even created my first blog without any site generators, all with my hands. Without CSS and JavaScript, I put all the stylesheets in attribute `style` and all the buttons are powered by links and images.

I joined GitHub in 2019 with my websites.

While trying, learning and practicing JavaScript, CSS and more, a year was past.

In 2020, I became more confident in my skills. I published two packages, [videoplayer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/videoplayer.js) and [tooltiplery.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tooltiplery.js) to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) in spring, 2020. However, they are no longer maintained.

In summer, 2020, I created my new blog with Hexo, the one you are now looking at. I also made a brand new theme for it - [Theme Cupertino](https://github.com/MrWillCom/hexo-theme-cupertino). Plus, I begin contributing to some open source projects.

I published a browser extension called [GitHub Dark Mode](https://github.com/MrWillCom/github-dark-mode) to implement the missing dark mode for GitHub.com.

In autumn, 2020, since GitHub officially implemented their dark mode, GitHub Dark Mode got archived. For some enhanced visual features on GitHub.com, I published [GitHub Enhancing](https://github.com/MrWillCom/github-enhancing). It adds acrylic and some animations to GitHub.com, which makes it more interactive.

In summer, 2021, [RSA CLI](https://rsa.js.org/) turned stable, and [RSA GUI](https://github.com/MrWillCom/rsa-gui) went into its beta test.

The summer of 2022, I bought the domain `mrwillcom.com`, all my websites had been migrated to it.

My [gallery](https://gallery.mrwillcom.com/) is born in April, 2023.
