I'm interested in why Apple Newsroom doesn't support dark appearance still.

Theme Cupertino's UI is based on Cupertino Design guidelines. And the cards are designed just like Apple Newsroom's Card. But today, it updated.

I think that I should update it to make Theme Cupertino more Cupertino Design. It's in progress now.
