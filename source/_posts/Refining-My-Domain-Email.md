I previously used [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net/) for my domain email. It could forward all emails sent to `*@mrwillcom.com` to my Outlook's inbox. However, it did not allow me to use `*@mrwillcom.com` to send emails from or reply to messages.

After transferring my domain from [Namesilo](https://www.namesilo.com/) + [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (as nameserver) to [Cloudflare](https://domains.cloudflare.com/), which reduced a small share of annual expense, I attempted to migrate to [Cloudflare Email Routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/email-routing/). While this also did not support sending emails, it offered a graph on its dashboard and a special feature — [Email Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/email-workers/).

Although Cloudflare’s products appeared promising, I was determined to send emails. This led me to seek out [Spacemail](https://www.spaceship.com/business-email/), which stood out for its eye-catching pricing. The starter plan contained all the features I needed at a cost of only $4.95/yr. I could hardly overlook this option.

By starting 30 day free trial, I have begun experiencing Spacemail. Spacemail has a clear web interface with essential functionalities built in, which is simple and responds fast.

With IMAP, SMTP and POP3 access, I don't have to stick to the web app. I now use [Apple Mail](https://support.apple.com/guide/mail/welcome/mac) and [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) for my domain email.

Welcome to send an email to [`hi@mrwillcom.com`](mailto:hi@mrwillcom.com)!
