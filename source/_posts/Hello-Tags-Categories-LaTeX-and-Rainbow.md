Introducing tags & categories features, $LaTeX$ and 🌈 rainbow banner. Update to experience them! 🆙

---

## Tags & Categories

Tags and categories are now implemented in Theme Cupertino. No further configuration required, just add `tags` and `categories` properties to your posts' front-matter.

## $LaTeX$

Really good news, LaTeX is now supported in Theme Cupertino:

$$
(x^2 + y^2 -1)^3 -x^2 y^3 = 0
$$

Or maybe like this:

$$
\rm
2NaOH + CO_2 \xlongequal{}{} Na_2CO_3 + H_2O
$$

By default, this feature is disabled and optional. You can choose the renderer you like. [Check out docs](https://github.com/MrWillCom/hexo-theme-cupertino/blob/master/docs/features/latex.md).

## 🌈 Rainbow Banner

June is coming, if you would like to show your pride and support LGBT, or just simply like the rainbow, you will certainly like this feature. It provides a gorgeous rainbow banner right on your navigation. It's also customizable, you can change its colors to any colors you want. [Check out docs](https://github.com/MrWillCom/hexo-theme-cupertino/blob/master/docs/features/rainbow-banner.md).
