I found that GitHub has published its own dark mode and that's pretty cool.

<div class="container" style="display: flex">
<p style="flex: 1"><small style="color: #888; font-weight: bold">Official Dark Mode</small><br />Really wonderful, supports more colors and components.</p>
<p style="flex: 1; text-align: right"><small style="color: #888; font-weight: bold">GitHub Dark Mode Extension</small><br />More colorful but doesn't support some special components.</p>
</div>

I'm currently enjoying using the official dark mode.

This means, GitHub Dark Mode Extension is useless now...

So, GitHub Dark Mode Extension will add more features to improve your experience like blur effects, smooth transitions and more.
